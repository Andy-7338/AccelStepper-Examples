# AccelStepper-Examples
IxLab examples codes for stepper motors based on by Mike McCauley AccelStepper library (mikem@airspayce.com)

  - Constant speed example: Shows how to run AccelStepper in the simplest, fixed speed mode with no accelerations.
  - Run to position example: Shows how to use the blocking call runToNewPosition which sets a new target position and then waits until the stepper has achieved it.
